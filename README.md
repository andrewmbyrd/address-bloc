##Address Bloc

This is a simple, command line program demonstrating the use of ruby files. 

##Configuration
As usual, to begin, go to the desired directory on your machine and clone this repository (use the green `Clone or download` button in the upper left.) 

You must have Ruby running on your machine in order for this to work. There are several ways to get this set up. If you don't have Ruby installed, you can start [here](http://installrails.com/) to do so.

To start up the program, in the command line, type in `ruby address_bloc.rb`. 


```bash
ruby address_bloc.rb
```

### Importing CSV files
Option 4 in the main menu of Address Bloc allows you to import contacts from a .csv file. You are provided with `entries.csv` and `entries2.csv` in this repo. You can append to the existing files using the pattern you see within the file.

To create a new .csv, just make sure the first line reads *exactly* `name,phone_number,email` and then on each subsequent line, the the person's first name, then a comma, then the phone number in xxx-xxx-xxxx format, then a comma, then the person's email. ***NO SPACES!***.

And thats it! Thanks for using Address Bloc!.
